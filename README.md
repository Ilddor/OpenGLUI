# Notes
So far library needs to run few other libraries:
-OpenGL Mathematics (to handle view and projection matrices)
-GLEW in version for OpenGL 3.3 or higher (it's recommended to use latest version)
The library is in *very* experimental stage right now. Feel free to submit your remarks as Issues.
If you are interested in commercial use, drop me an email.
